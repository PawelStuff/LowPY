# More and about
as of current version ("Strawberry" and further) LowPY is ment to be more of a script editor than a entire ide like thing<br />
that doesnt mean you cannot write scripts in it but it isnt ideal<br />
<br />
# Reporting crashes and help
if you need any help with LowPY or any other of my works you can get help on my discord <br />
