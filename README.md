# More and about
LowPY requires .NET Framework 6.0 installed (and for local install running Python 3.10)<br />
as of current version ("Strawberry" and further) LowPY is ment to be more of a script editor than a entire ide like thing<br />
that doesnt mean you cannot write scripts in it but it isnt ideal<br />
<br />
# Reporting crashes and help
if you need any help with LowPY or any other of my works you can get help on my discord <br />
permament invite : https://discord.com/invite/XwgWYHCbd6 <br />
the version name aswell as this invite can be found inside LowPY by clicking the LowPY logo in the editor 6 times <br />
<br />
# The editor itself

as of the editor of the version "Strawberry" is pretty basic <br />
it contains your basic stuff like saving and of course executing <br />
"Run with local Python 3.10 install" is in case the built in Script Runner doesnt work <br />
about the said script runner bellow <br />
<br />

# Script runner
<img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/578453280405848064/966387402513977384/unknown.png">
the script runner runs your currently loaded script into the editor, gives back syntax when the script contains a error <br />
in case the "Script runner" doesnt work theres the "Run with local Python 3.10 install" option which as mentioned before <br />
opens your local Python 3.10 install with the currently loaded script
